# UnityPortfolio
A repository for my Unity Portfolio.

This repository is dedicated to my Unity Portfolio. I will be gradually pushing anything I deem worthy for the eyes of those interested parties.

I recommend looking at the "RPGTutorial" or the "ActionRPGTutorial" source as those are the projects I spent most of my time on currently; I feel that they show my knowledge on C# and Unity the most.

Thanks for your visitation.
